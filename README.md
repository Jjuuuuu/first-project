    # 2022 First Update

    This is my first html & css project
    In this project, I'm trying to clone CSS for KaKaoTalk


    what I learned from this project:
    1. How to use VSC & Git & Github
        __ writing README.md
        __ using prettier by creating .prettierrc to make your code look better

    2. How to write code in VSC
        in html :
          __ ! (html)
          __ link:css (external css)
          __ nav>ul>il*4>a

        in css :
            __ reset.css :
                -- search "css reset" and find 2.0 version
                -- removing default browser settings so that you can be able to control the style the way you want.
            __ BEM : block__element--modifier

        .prettierrc

        reset.css
          __ search "css reset" and find 2.0 version

        use chrome extension
          __ Page Ruler Redux extension

    3. form tag
        __ 2 powerful attributes : action & method
            -- action="" : to which page are you going to sent this data
            -- method="post" : to send information to backend server
            -- method="get" : low security. Never send username or password. Use when nly data that is okay to be seen on the url.
